              Nutrition is a contributing factor to almost all ailments. From heartburn to diabetes to celiac disease, there are diet and supplement options to help alleviate symptoms naturally. At Oakland Park Rehab Center, we recognize that what you put into your body directly impacts how well it functions and heals.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
              <p>
                Our approach to nutritional consultation goes beyond generic dietary advice. We use comprehensive metabolic assessments and targeted blood work analysis to develop personalized nutrition strategies that address the root causes of your health concerns and support your body's natural healing processes.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Our Approach to Nutritional Consultation</h3>
            <p>
              Our initial consultation consists of a metabolic assessment and specific blood work pertaining to your unique health issues. Dr. Samuel will analyze the results and create a personalized strategy that may include diet changes, targeted supplements, and when appropriate, complementary neurological rehabilitation.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don't believe in one-size-fits-all nutrition plans. Your body has unique needs, and our goal is to identify those needs through thorough assessment and develop a nutrition strategy that supports your specific health goals.
            </p>

            <h3>Comprehensive Metabolic Assessment</h3>
            <p>
              During your nutritional consultation, we begin with a thorough metabolic assessment. This comprehensive evaluation helps us understand your body's unique metabolic profile, identify nutritional deficiencies, and recognize any metabolic imbalances that may be contributing to your health concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
              We look at factors such as energy levels, digestive function, hormonal balance, and inflammatory markers to get a complete picture of how your metabolism is functioning. This detailed assessment allows us to identify underlying issues that may not be apparent through symptoms alone.
            </p>

            <h3>Targeted Blood Work Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              We use specific blood work to get a complete picture of your health. This targeted approach allows us to identify nutritional deficiencies, metabolic imbalances, and underlying health issues that may not be apparent through symptoms alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              By analyzing your blood work in detail, we can develop a more precise and effective nutritional strategy. This scientific approach ensures that our recommendations are based on your actual physiological needs, not just general dietary guidelines.
            </p>

            <h3>Personalized Treatment Strategy</h3>
            <p>
              Based on your assessment and blood work results, Dr. Samuel will create a personalized treatment strategy tailored to your specific needs. This comprehensive plan may include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Dietary Modifications:</strong> Specific dietary changes designed to support your body's healing and optimal function. We'll provide clear guidelines and practical meal planning suggestions to make implementation easier.</li>
              <li><strong>Supplement Protocols:</strong> Targeted supplements to address nutritional deficiencies and support your body's natural healing processes. We'll explain what each supplement does and why it's important for your specific situation.</li>
              <li><strong>Neurological Rehabilitation:</strong> When appropriate, combining nutritional support with neurological rehab for comprehensive care that addresses both metabolic and neurological aspects of your health.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conditions We Address</h3>
            <p>
