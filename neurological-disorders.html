              Chiropractic Neurology, specifically the Melillo Method, can help alleviate symptoms of developmental delays and neurological disorders like Parkinson's, Autism Spectrum Disorder, ADHD, and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Our specialized approach targets the neurological system to support healing and improve function.

                Unlike traditional chiropractic care that primarily addresses the spine, chiropractic neurology targets the brain and nervous system to improve function and alleviate symptoms of neurological conditions. This comprehensive approach recognizes that many health challenges originate from neurological imbalances that can be addressed through targeted interventions.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Understanding Chiropractic Neurology</h3>
            <p>
              Chiropractic Neurology is a specialized field that focuses on the relationship between the nervous system and overall health. The brain controls every function in your body, and when neurological pathways are disrupted or underdeveloped, it can affect physical, cognitive, and emotional well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our chiropractic neurology approach uses advanced assessment techniques to identify specific areas of neurological dysfunction. Once we understand what's happening in your nervous system, we can develop targeted treatment plans that stimulate and rehabilitate those specific areas.
            </p>

            <h3>Conditions We Treat</h3>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Parkinson's Disease:</strong> Our approach helps manage symptoms and improve quality of life through targeted neurological interventions. We focus on supporting motor function, balance, and overall neurological health to help you maintain independence and improve daily function.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD):</strong> Chiropractic neurology can help address sensory processing issues, improve communication, enhance social interactions, and support overall function. Our comprehensive approach works with children and adults on the spectrum to help them reach their full potential.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder):</strong> We work to improve focus, attention, executive function, and cognitive processing through neurological rehabilitation. Our treatment helps address the underlying neurological factors that contribute to ADHD symptoms.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):</strong> Our treatments help restore neural pathways, improve cognitive function, support emotional regulation, and enhance overall brain recovery after brain injury. We understand that every brain injury is unique and requires individualized care.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Developmental Delays:</strong> Early intervention with chiropractic neurology can support healthy development in children. By identifying and addressing neurological immaturities, we can help children catch up developmentally and reach important milestones.
            </p>

            <h3>The Melillo Method</h3>
            <p>
              The Melillo Method is a research-based technique that allows trained practitioners to evaluate and treat children suffering from neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism, Dyslexia, OCD, and more. Our neurological approach allows us to isolate specific regions of immaturity in order to stimulate them using co-activation via a variety of sensory-motor therapies.
            </p>
            <p>
              This method recognizes that neurodevelopmental disorders often stem from imbalances between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. By identifying these imbalances and using targeted interventions to stimulate underdeveloped areas, we can help the brain develop more balanced function.
            </p>
