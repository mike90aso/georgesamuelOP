            <p>
              Our body's tissues need oxygen to function. The air we breathe is 21% oxygen. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) involves breathing 100% pure oxygen while in a special space called a hyperbaric chamber, where the air pressure inside is raised to a level that is higher than normal air pressure.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
              <p>
                The increased air pressure in the chamber helps the lungs collect more oxygen. Getting more oxygen to the tissues that need it can help the body heal and fight certain infections. However, it's important to understand that too much oxygen can cause damage to the body, which is why our treatments are carefully monitored and performed according to established safety protocols.

            <h3>FDA-Cleared Conditions</h3>
            <p>
              FDA clearance of a medical device includes a determination that the device has the same intended use as, and is as safe and effective as, another legally U.S.-marketed device of that type. As of July 2021, the FDA has cleared hyperbaric chambers for the following disorders:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Air and gas bubbles in blood vessels</li>
              <li>Anemia (severe anemia when blood transfusions cannot be used)</li>
              <li>Burns (severe and large burns treated at a specialized burn center)</li>
              <li>Carbon monoxide poisoning</li>
              <li>Crush injury</li>
              <li>Decompression sickness (diving risk)</li>
              <li>Gas gangrene</li>
              <li>Hearing loss (complete hearing loss that occurs suddenly and without any known cause)</li>
              <li>Infection of the skin and bone (severe)</li>
              <li>Radiation injury</li>
              <li>Skin graft flap at risk of tissue death</li>
              <li>Vision loss (when sudden and painless in one eye due to blockage of blood flow)</li>
              <li>Wounds (non-healing, diabetic foot ulcers)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Other Conditions We Use HBOT For</h3>
            <p>
              In addition to FDA-cleared conditions, we also use Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in our office for:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Autism Spectrum Disorders:</strong> HBOT may help improve neurological function and support overall wellness in individuals with autism by increasing oxygen delivery to the brain and supporting neural development.</li>
              <li><strong>ADHD:</strong> Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can support cognitive function and attention in individuals with ADHD by enhancing oxygen delivery to the brain.</li>
              <li><strong>Parkinson's Disease:</strong> HBOT may help manage symptoms and improve quality of life for individuals with Parkinson's disease through enhanced oxygen support for neurological function.</li>
              <li><strong>Traumatic Brain Injury:</strong> The enhanced oxygen delivery can support brain healing and recovery after traumatic brain injury by promoting neural repair and reducing inflammation.</li>
              <li><strong>Brain Fog:</strong> HBOT may help improve cognitive clarity and reduce brain fog by increasing oxygen delivery to the brain and supporting optimal neurological function.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Works</h3>
            <p>
              During a hyperbaric oxygen therapy session, you'll breathe 100% pure oxygen while inside a pressurized chamber. The increased pressure allows your lungs to absorb significantly more oxygen than would be possible under normal atmospheric pressure. This oxygen-rich blood is then circulated throughout your body, delivering enhanced oxygen to tissues that need it for healing and recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              The enhanced oxygen delivery helps support the body's natural healing processes by promoting cellular repair, reducing inflammation, and supporting the growth of new blood vessels. This can accelerate healing and recovery for a variety of conditions.
            </p>

            <h3>Safety and Effectiveness</h3>
            <p>
              Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is performed under controlled conditions with proper medical supervision. While the treatment is generally safe when performed correctly, it's important to understand that too much oxygen can cause damage to the body. That's why we carefully monitor each session and ensure that treatments are performed according to established safety protocols.
            </p>
